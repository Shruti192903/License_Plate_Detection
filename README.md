# License_Plate_Detection

## Automatic License Plate Detection

This project implements an Automatic License Plate Detection (ALPD) system using Python, OpenCV, and Tesseract OCR. It detects vehicles in an image or video stream and extracts the license plate information using computer vision techniques.

## Features

- Vehicle detection using OpenCV's pre-trained object detection models
- License plate detection using contour analysis and morphological operations
- License plate character recognition using Tesseract OCR
- Support for multiple license plate formats (e.g., Indian, US, European)
- Configurable parameters for fine-tuning the detection and recognition process
